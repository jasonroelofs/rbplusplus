h3. Synopsis

Rbgccxml is a C++ source code querying library. It makes use of "GCC-XML":http://www.gccxml.org and "nokogiri":http://nokogiri.org/ to process the C++ code (currently only headers and not body code) into easy to read XML, then opens up a very simple but powerful query API for searching everything about the code.

Rbgccxml is released under the "MIT Licence":http://github.com/jameskilton/rbgccxml/tree/master/MIT_LICENCE

h3. Installation

gem install rbgccxml
